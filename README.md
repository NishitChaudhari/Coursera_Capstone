# Optimal-location-for-opening-a-restaurant
Prior launching any restaurant, itâ€™s important to know if the business has a good opportunity. In order to do so, this report will try to gather data about other restaurant localization, competitors and best localization. 

We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promising neighborhoods based on these criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders. As the goal of this is to create a business plan in the end, we need to make sure data from Api are correct. We also need to check that customer could be interested in this specific business.
